# Bankaks Hiring Challenge

## Tasks
#### 1. Dockerize, customise and deploy microservices

Observation :
  A) The node code provided in directory "services/carsInt" is designed to extract data from file named "data.json" which is static file in the directory itself.
  
  B) As mentioned in README.md, I could understand that we need to have a remote data store (I assumed it to be AWS RDS here) for storing the data provided in the file
     "data.json" and then read and write data to that remote datatbase.
  
  C) I don't have much experience with node but I could observe the code provided, it is meant to serve static data source i.e., the "data.json" file.
  
  D) However as much I could, I changed few things in "cardInt" to make the the server read from the remote databse dynamically.
  
  E) To meet the desired requiredment, I suppose the whole code needs to be revamped to suit the read as well as write form remote datatbase.

  F) Similar to "carsInt", few tweaks maybe required for "carsExt" as well.

  G) However, for the main job i.e., to Dockerize these servers, I've added Dockerfile and datatbase.js file to both the directories. I've also made few changes in "index.js"
      file of "carsInt".

  H) I've added a docker-compose.yml file that will ensure that both the containers are up and running.
     
  I) Use the command "sudo docker-compose up -d" and in few minutes you'll have two containers up and running. You'll be able to check the containers using 
     "sudo docker ps"

  J) The "carsInt" directory container will be running on port 3000 and "carsExt" directory container on port 3001 of your server.


#### 2. Remote Data Store

Database used :
  A) I've used AWS RDS MySQL database for storing the data provided in "data.json" file.

  B) These are the following credentials for the database incase you want to verify :
     host: "project.cpvf71ejomwc.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
     user: "project",
     port:3306,
     password: "Project123",
     database: "bankaks"

#### 3. Remote server used to Deploy this containers

EC2 Virtual Machine used :

   A) I've used AWS EC2 t2.micro instance to deploy the containers.

   B) I've installed docker on the server as it will be required to run the docker services.

   C) Following is the details of the server :
      IP : 54.147.240.183

   D) Use 54.147.240.183:3000 to connect to "carsInt" container and 54.147.240.183:3001 to connect to "carsExt" container.

NOTE : Since all these details regarding AWS resources will be in public Repository, I will delete these resources soon. 
       Please let me know is this needs to be retained.




Additional Observations :
 A) If read and write needs to be done in internal microservice than changes to code shall be made 
    and a tool such as "POSTMAN" will be required to write data on the database.
 
 B) I can improve the conterization of this NodeJS code but it needs to be altered for dynamically read and write.
    And I suppose as NodeJS can do it way better than me.
